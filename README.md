# Movies List

You are given `src/data/movies.json` and initial markup in the `src/App.vue`. Your task is to:

1. Render one `.card` per movie using `v-for`.
1. Use `movie.imdbId` as a key.
1. Keep all `data-cy` attributes to pass the tests.

## Instructions
- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.
- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/react_movies-list-js/) and add it to the PR description.
